# NoteWorthy
An app to record your stories and ideas.

## Inspiration
To make NoteWorthy, we combined the functionality of two preset apps, the Calendar and the Notes apps. NoteWorthy's goal wasn't to be better than these apps, it was just supposed to create a combination that was more functional than using both different apps seperately. 

## Naming and usability
Part of NoteWorthy's job is to let you record your previous stories and memories worth telling, hence the name NoteWorthy. It also allows you to write down a list of things you need, such as a grocery list.
